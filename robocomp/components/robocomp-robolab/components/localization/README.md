# Localization Components

**Localization components** handle state or pose estimation tasks for mobile entities. This category consists of these components:
- `aprilBasedLocalizationComp`: component estimates global pose based on April Tag sensor model.
- `poseEstimation` component estimates 3D and 2D pose based on a RGB image using PyTorch.
- `RealSensePoseEstimation` component estimates 3D and 2D pose based using laser sensor model, e.g Intel RealSense.

The detail of the description, installation, and configuration of each component can be found on the respective component folder.
